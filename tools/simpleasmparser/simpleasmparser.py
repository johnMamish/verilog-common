# This library contains a few utiity classes that make it easy to parse simple assembly languages
# of the form:
#
# # This is a comment
# _label:
#     instr1 a b c       # do instruction 1 with args a, b, and c.
#     instr2
#     instr1 c b d
#     instr3 _label
#
# and then emit hex files.
#
# assembly languages are specified by:
#   1. Declaring instructions by inheriting from the Instruction class
#   2. Registering those instructions with a Parser using the 'register_instruction' method
